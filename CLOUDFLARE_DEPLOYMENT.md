# Cloudflare Pages - DO NOT BUILD

This is a static HTML site. The `index.html` is pre-generated by `generate_ui.py`.

## Cloudflare Pages Configuration

### Build Settings (CRITICAL)
```
Framework preset:     None
Build command:        (leave empty)
Build output directory: /
```

### Environment Variables (Required for GitHub Actions only)
The build runs in GitHub Actions, not Cloudflare. Cloudflare just serves the static files.

## How It Works

1. **GitHub Actions** (weekdays at 14:25 UTC):
   - Runs `generate_ui.py`
   - Creates `index.html`
   - Commits back to repository

2. **Cloudflare Pages**:
   - Detects commit
   - Deploys `index.html` (no build needed)
   - Makes dashboard live

## If Cloudflare Tries to Build

**Error:** `error occurred while running build command`

**Cause:** Cloudflare is trying to install Python dependencies and run build commands

**Fix:** Configure Cloudflare to deploy as static site:
- Build command: **(empty)**
- Root directory: `/`
- Output directory: `/`

Cloudflare should just deploy the files as-is, not try to build anything.
